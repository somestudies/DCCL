Hi, welcome to our DCCL ([Disentangled Causal Embedding With Contrastive Learning For Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03248). Accepted by the industry track of WWW'23) program.

# KS-DCCL
This code was used for offline experiments of DCCL. You can reproduce the offline experiments in the paper by executing 
```
python main.py
```

# KS-dataset
The industrial Short-video dataset is collected from Kuaishou (a billion-user scale short-video recommender system: https://www.kuaishou.com/new-reco). However, due to national policy restrictions, our database cannot be released at present, and we apologize for this.
